# BuzzFeed Quiz | Template (School Project)

## Disclaimer !!!
This is a school project, dont expect much from this like AT ALL. Just made this to branch out to a couple of friends who dunno what their doing and just need a quick grade. This will be updated when needed to.

## Whats this?
What this Github repository is presenting here is a Template of what a [BuzzFeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/) Quiz would look like coded with [HTML](https://github.com/search?q=HTML&type=repositories), [CSS](https://github.com/search?q=CSS&type=repositories), & now [JavaScript]()! This is mainly a school project based off my current knowledge of HTML, CSS & Javascript! so dont expect much.
